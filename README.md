# CoreServer

CoreServer is a reimplementation of a Minecraft 1.8 server. It uses zero proprietary code, and no portions of Bukkit, Spigot, etc. It was originally intended as a platform for lightweight minigame servers, and uses light instanced worlds loaded from .schematic files. Currently supports basic player/block interaction, logging in, sending worlds, basic entities, and... probably some more?

I originally developed it with a friend, @AzureusNation, in the middle of 2015. Over time development fizzled out, and the original repository was lost to time. This repository contains decompiled source from a .jar file I found lying around dated August 1st 2015. We likely added more features later on, but those are now lost. This project is dead and abandoned, and I leave the source here only for future reference, and as a cool early portfolio piece. The code itself is in src/com/azureusnation/coreserver, with the rest of the source being decompiled dependencies I include for completeness.
